This folder contains a stepwise analysis of building a CNN model for MNIST digits dataset. We perform this in five steps, with the following target:  
1. 99.4% Test accuracy.  
2. Less than or equal to 15 Epochs.  
3. Less than 10000 Parameters.  

```
Targets:  

Check if the code works properly.
Set up a basic model.
Analyzing the dataset. 
Results: 

Best train accuracy :  99.3%
Best test accuracy :  98.82%
Number of parameters :  120,608
Analysis:

Code works fine without any issues.
Model is heavier than what might be required for this dataset.
