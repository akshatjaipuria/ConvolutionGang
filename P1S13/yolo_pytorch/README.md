## Training YOLO V3 for custom dataset on pytorch
- I created a dataset of 500 images, taking pikachu ![pikachu](https://cdn.emojidex.com/emoji/mdpi/pikachu.png "pikachu") as the class .
- These images were annotated and the yolo model was trained, over the pretrained coco dataset weights.
- Customdata folder contains the images as well as the annotation files. I have uploaded the zipped folder due to large number of files.
- The training was done for 300 epochs, you can refer to this <a href="https://github.com/akshatjaipuria/EVA/blob/master/P1S13/yolo_pytorch/YoloV3_pytorch.ipynb" target="_blank">`Notebook`</a>.
